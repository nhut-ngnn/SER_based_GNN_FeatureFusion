## Processing 
In this process, I extract feature from **IEMOCAP dataset** based **Chroma_fft** config by openSMILE 3.0.2. After that, I have 3 files:
 - IEMOCAP.csv
 - IEMOCAP_data.npy
 - IEMOCAP_label.npy
 The resulting 'IEMOCAP.txt' file appears to be formatted for a specific purpose, possibly for use in a graph neural network (GNN) or another machine learning model that requires this particular input format.
